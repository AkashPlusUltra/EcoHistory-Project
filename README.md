# EcoHistory-Project

## About the Project
The EcoHistory Project was intended to be a Coffee Table Book that would tell the story of India since independence through data and data visualisations. The book would include written chapters explaining India's history as well as graphic data representations to contextualise these chapters.

However, this project could not be completed and remains incomplete to this day. Even so, a tremendous amount of effort went into this project and this repository is intended to be a compilation of the chapters and graphs that were completed for the project. 

The writing, editing, analysis, and graph creation were all completed in-house by the Research, Analytics, and Data (RAD) team of the Economics and Public Policy Cell (EPPC) at SSLA. The graphs were created using Python and Pandas and the code was executed in a Jupyter Notebook.
